# Engine

We were previously using the 'Pathos' Engine, however we changed to "Pragma Engine" as it is more modern, closer to source 2  and better in general, Our modified pathos, named "Matrix engine" is still available but obsolete

# Legal

Unfortunately since both of our owners are teenagers we arent registered as an LLC or any other legal entity, However when we are 18 we will most likely sign as LLC
